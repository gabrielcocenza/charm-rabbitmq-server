    description: |
      List of dictionaries containing the policies applied in the cluster.
      Every policy should have at least the fields: 'vhost', 'name' and 'pattern'.
      It's strongly encouraged to specify the 'type' of the policy which can be found
      at the module policies.py.
      If vhost field is equal to '*' the policy will be applied on all vhosts available.
      Must be a valid JSON document.
  cluster-partition-handling:
    type: string
    default: ignore
    description: |
      RabbitMQ offers three ways to deal with network partitions automatically.
      Available modes:
      .
      ignore - Your network is reliable. All your nodes are in a rack,
      connected with a switch, and that switch is also the route to the outside
      world. You don't want to run any risk of any of your cluster shutting
      down if any other part of it fails (or you have a two node cluster).
      .
      pause_minority - Your network is maybe less reliable. You have clustered
      across 3 AZs in EC2, and you assume that only one AZ will fail at once.
      In that scenario you want the remaining two AZs to continue working and
      the nodes from the failed AZ to rejoin automatically and without fuss
      when the AZ comes back.
      .
      autoheal - Your network may not be reliable. You are more concerned with
      continuity of service than with data integrity. You may have a two node
      cluster.
      .

  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True, services that support it will log to syslog instead of their
      normal log location.
  max-cluster-tries:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      Number of tries to cluster with other units before giving up and throwing
      a hook error.
  min-cluster-size:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Minimum number of units expected to exist before charm will attempt to
      form a rabbitmq cluster.
  stats_cron_schedule:
    type: string
    default: '*/5 * * * *'
    description: |
      Cron schedule used to generate rabbitmq stats. To disable,
      either unset this config option or set it to an empty string ('').
  cron-timeout:
    type: int
    default: 300
    description: |
      Run a command with a time limit specified in seconds in cron.
      This timeout will govern to the rabbitmq stats capture, and that once
      the timeout is reached a SIGINT is sent to the program, if it doesn't
      exits before 10 seconds a SIGKILL is sent. Note that from xenial onwards
      the nrpe queue check will alert if stats are not updated as expected
  queue_thresholds:
    type: string
    default: "[['\\*', '\\*', 100, 200]]"
    description: |
      List of RabbitMQ queue size check thresholds. Interpreted as YAML in
      format [<vhost>, <queue>, <warn>, <crit>]
      Per-queue thresholds can be expressed as a multi-line YAML array:
      - ['/', 'queue1', 10, 20]
      - ['/', 'queue2', 200, 300]
      Or as a list of lists:
      [['/', 'queue1', 10, 20], ['/', 'queue2', 200, 300]]
      Wildcards '*' are accepted to monitor all vhosts and/or queues.
      In case of multiple matches, only the first will apply: wildcards should
      therefore be used last in order to avoid unexpected behavior.
  exclude_queues:
    type: string
    default: "[]"
    description: |
      List of RabbitMQ queues that should be skipped when checking thresholds.
      Interpreted as YAML in format [<vhost>, <queue>]
      Per-queue thresholds can be expressed as a multi-line YAML array:
      - ['/', 'queue1']
      - ['/', 'queue2']
      Or as a list of lists:
      [['/', 'queue1'], ['/', 'queue2']]
      Wildcards '*' are accepted to exclude, for example, single queue on all
      hosts. Note that the wildcard asterisk must be double-escaped. Example:
      [['\\*', 'queue1']]
  busiest_queues:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of the busiest RabbitMQ queues to display when warning and
      critical checking thresholds are exceeded. Queues are displayed in
      decreasing message count order.
  connection-backlog:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Overrides the size of the connection backlog maintained by the server.
      Environments with large numbers of clients will want to set this value
      higher than the default (default value varies with rabbtimq version, see
      https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html for more info).
  erl-vm-io-thread-multiplier:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Multiplier used to calculate the number of threads used in the erl vm
      worker thread pool using the number of CPU cores extant in
      the host system. The upstream docs recommend that this multiplier be
      > 12 per core - we use 24 as default so that we end up with roughly the
      same as current rabbitmq package defaults and that is what is used
      internally to the charm if no value is set here. Also, if this value is
      left unset and this application is running inside a container, the number
      of threads will be capped based on a maximum of 2 cores.
  # SSL configuration
  ssl:
    type: string
    default: "off"
    description: |
      Enable SSL for client communication. Valid values are 'off', 'on', and
      'only'. If ssl_key, ssl_cert, ssl_ca are provided then those values will
      be used. Otherwise the service will act as its own certificate authority
      and pass its CA certificate to clients. For clustered RabbitMQ, ssl_key
      and ssl_cert must be provided.
      .
      Vault can be used instead of the ssl_* config values and works for
      clustered and non-clustered cases.
  ssl_enabled:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      (DEPRECATED see 'ssl' config option.) enable SSL
  ssl_port:
    type: int
    default: 5671
    description: SSL port
  ssl_key:

      "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----")
    default:
  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    description: |
      X.509 certificate in base64 PEM format (i.e. starts with
      "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----")
    default:
  ssl_ca:
    type: string
    description: |
      Certificate authority cert that the cert. Optional if the ssl_cert is
      signed by a ca recognized by the os. Format is base64 PEM (concatenated
      certs if needed).
    default:
  # Network configuration (by default all access is over 'private-address')
  access-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the 'access' network (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      This network will be used for access to RabbitMQ messaging services.
  cluster-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the 'cluster' network (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      This network will be used for RabbitMQ to cluster.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  # Monitoring
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
          juju-myservice-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup.
  # HA configuration (DEPRECATED)
  vip:
    type: string

    default:
  vip_iface:
    type: string

    description: "Network Interface where to place the Virtual IP"
  vip_cidr:
    type: int
    default: 24
    description: "Netmask that will be used for the Virtual IP"
  ha-bindiface:
    type: string

      Default network interface on which HA cluster will bind to communication
      with the other members of the HA Cluster.
  ha-mcastport:
    type: int
    default: 5406
    description: |
      Default multicast port number that will be used to communicate between
      HA Cluster nodes.
  ha-vip-only:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      By default, without pairing with hacluster charm, rabbitmq will deploy
      in active/active/active... HA. When pairied with hacluster charm, it
      will deploy as active/passive. By enabling this option, pairing with
      hacluster charm will keep rabbit in active/active setup, but in addition
      it will deploy a VIP that can be used by services that cannot work
      with mutiple AMQPs (like Glance in pre-Icehouse).
  modulo-nodes:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      This config option is rarely required but is provided for fine tuning, it
      is safe to leave unset. Modulo nodes is used to help avoid restart
      collisions as well as distribute load on the cloud at larger scale.
      During restarts and cluster joins rabbitmq needs to execute these
      operations serially. By setting modulo-nodes to the size of the cluster
      and known-wait to a reasonable value, the charm will distribute the
      operations serially. If this value is unset, the charm will check
      min-cluster-size or else finally default to the size of the cluster
      based on peer relations. Setting this value to 0 will execute operations
      with no wait time. Setting this value to less than the cluster size will
      distribute load but may lead to restart collisions.
  known-wait:
    type: int
    default: 30
    description: |
      Known wait along with modulo nodes is used to help avoid restart
      collisions. Known wait is the amount of time between one node executing
      an operation and another. On slower hardware this value may need to be
      larger than the default of 30 seconds.
  check-vhosts:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      When using nrpe to monitor the Rabbitmq host, we monitor functionality on
      one vhost.  This option configures additional vhost name(s) to check.
      Space separated list.
  queue-master-locator:
    type: string
    default: min-masters
    description: |
      Queue master location strategy. Available strategies are:
         - min-masters, Pick the node hosting the minimum number of bound masters.
         - client-local, Pick the node the client that declares the queue is connected to.
         - random, Pick a random node.
      This option is only available for RabbitMQ >= 3.6
  enable-auto-restarts:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: |
      Allow the charm and packages to restart services automatically when
      required.
